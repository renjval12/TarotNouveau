# Tarot Nouveau ðŸ”®

"Take the mysticism out of the mystics!" is the tagline for Tarot Nouveau.
Tarot Nouveau, is a React application whose main function is to provide any user that visits, with easily digestable, 3 and/or 5 card tarot readings.
The user need only to choose their cards, input/ask their question, to find out what the cards have to say about it.

Additionally, if the user is looking to the stars for some insight on who they are, as well, they can go to the 'Ask the Stars' page for horoscope info.
If they want to consult the crystal ball, they can also go to the "Ask the Crystal Ball" section.

The demographic I am intending to target with this application, are millennials and Gen-Z.

This app, integrates data from the following APIs:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ekswagger/rws-tarot_card_api/1.0.0">Ekswagger RWS Tarot Card Rest API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aztro.sameerkumar.website/">Aztro API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://8ball.delegator.com/">8Ball API</a></li>
</ul>
